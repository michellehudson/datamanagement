DDI Lifecycle model

![DDI lifecycle model](https://raw.github.com/michellehudson/datamanagement/master/images/ddilifecycle.png "Model based on the DDI Lifecycle")

!

# What is research data?

"the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings." OMB Circular A-110

!

## There are four types of research data:

1. Observational: captured in real time, usually irreplaceable (sensor readings, telescope images, sample data, surveys).
2. Experimental: data from lab equipment, can be reproducible but may be expensive (gene sequences).
3. Simulation: data generated from test models (climate models).
4. Derived or compiled: reproducible but expensive (data mining, compiled databases).

!

Research data comes in many formats of information: documents, spreadsheets, field notebooks, survey responses, audio and video recordings, images, film, specimens, software code, and can be structured and stored in a variety of file formats.

!

# Why manage research data?

## Transparency, integrity, and reproducibility

## Compliance

## Personal & professional benefits

!

# Study concept

## What does this stage involve?

Formulating a research question; deciding on methods; grant submission; data management planning.

!

# Study concept

## Tools & resources:

### [DMPTool](https://dmp.cdlib.org/)

### [DMP Consultation Group](http://csssi.yale.edu/dmp)

### [StatLab consultants](http://csssi.yale.edu/csssi-statistical-consultants-schedule)

# Data collection & documentation

## What does this stage involve?

Collection & documentation of data; collaborations with colleagues. 

!

# Data documentation

## Study-level description

1. Context of the data collection (project history, aim, objectives, and hypotheses)
2. Data collection methods (sampling, data collection process, instruments used, hardware and software used to collect data, scale and resolution, temporal and geographic coverage, secondary data sources used, if any)
3. Data set structure â€“ of files, study cases, and relationships between files
4. Changes made to data over time
5. Information on access and use conditions or data confidentiality

!

# Data documentation
## File-level description

1. Names, labels, and descriptions for variables, records, and their values
2. Definition of codes & classification schemes used
3. Codes of and reasons for missing values

!

# Data documentation

# Data documentation

## Guidelines:

1. Spreadsheets vs. databases: see the upcoming workshop on database design: 4/18/2014, 1:30 - 3:30 CSSSI.
2. Consistency: whatever you do, stick with it.
3. Level of detail: decide how much detail you'll need now and in the future.

!

# Data documentation

## Example

The codebook for the [General Social Survey](http://www3.norc.org/GSS+Website/) is an enormous document that helps researchers use the data effectively and ensures that every variable is described.

!

# Data processing & analysis

## What does this stage involve?

processing data: cleaning, refining, integrating, organizing, analyzing.

!

# Data processing & analysis

## Tools & resources:

#### [Software](http://csssi.yale.edu/tech):
- Stata
- SAS
- MatLab
- R
- OpenRefine
- Python
- [DataONE software tools catalog](http://www.dataone.org/software_tools_catalog)

# Data processing & analysis

## People!

#### StatLab consultants:

# Data processing & analysis
## Guidelines:
1. Keep track of everything you do.
2. Best practices for working with data during analysis -- folder structures, naming conventions, statistical package considerations.
3. How to back up data

!

# Data processing & analysis

## Tools & resources:

### Lists of repositories:

A few projects aim to list all the data repositories available for submission or for finding research data to reuse, and you can search or browse by subject:

#### [DataBib](http://databib.org/)
#### [re3data](http://www.re3data.org)

!


# Data processing & analysis

## Guidelines: 
1. Doing preservation yourself requires format migration and ensuring integrity of files.
2. Handing over your data to a repository like ICPSR is possible, and will ensure the data is usable over the long-term.

!


# Data processing & analysis

## Examples: 

#### [Institution for Social & Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/research#.UwJU7IVnCSo)
ISPS is a Yale department that maintains a data archive of research that has been conducted by their affiliates.

#### [ICPSR](http://icpsr.umich.edu)
The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social research is a domain archive that has been curating and maintaining access to data sets for over 50 years.

!

# Data distribution & citation

## What does this stage involve?

This is the stage (usually after archiving) where you can make your data, or a link to your data available, so that others know they can get your raw materials and use them in their own research, or check your studies for replication. 

!

# Data distribution & citation

## Tools & resources:

#### [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/)
#### [DataBib](http://databib.org/)
#### [re3data](http://www.re3data.org)

!

# Data distribution & citation

## Guidelines:
1. Give your data set a title and make it easy to credit you.
2. Always cite data that you use as if it were as important as the journal articles you cite.

!

# Data distribution & citation

## Examples:
1. ICPSR data citation
2. DataCite data citation

!
